# Randle

### _In case [Loldle](https://loldle.net/) or [Pokelde](https://pokedle.gg/) was getting boring_

#### Two options to run:

1. API and UI hot reloading ran separately

```
	cd server/randle
	npm run dev-api-only
	--- seperate terminal
	cd client/randle
	npm run dev
```

2. Serve static UI through hot reloaded API

```
	cd server/randle
	npm run dev
```
